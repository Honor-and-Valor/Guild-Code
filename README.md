## Organic Laws

### The Litany of Honor and Valor
In the beginning, there was naught but those who sought to walk in the Light—to set wrong things right—to stand tall and proud rather than cower from the fight.

They came from the south.
They came from the north.
But the gaps between them on a map became as nothing as they adventured forth.
 
For those gaps were bridged with a bond.
Acquaintances became friendships, until finally a family dawned.
That bond was not mightily forged in a day, it took years: grown steadily, nurtured with laughter and tears.
 
Some of them came and some of them went.
On desperate occasions their principles bent.
Moments of glory waxed and waned.
All too often they lost hope, along with all else they thought they had gained.
But amidst all the drama and odds that had left them drained, hope was never truly lost, for the family remained.
 
And lo, at long last, it was finally decided that the problem was not “in whom” but “how” the power resided.
It had always been known that for goals to be achieved that one and only one of them could be called upon to lead.
But now, as obligations or apathy pull one leader away, another of the family will answer the call and enter the fray.
 
This flaw in the past was not easily found, especially whenever hucksters sewing distrust did abound.
But now we understand that all in time will break down when saddled with the full weight of the crown.
 
To consecrate this litany and honor that we have all bled, the Marshal has rightfully begun his tenure when he has said: “Through our shared years and tears, I trust in my brothers as I take this throne that none of us again shall be asked to walk an unending path alone.”

#### Article I
This guild holds that all players possess rights which are corollaries of ethics as applied to social organizations.
These are: the right to one's own characters; the right to play as one wishes; the right to keep, use, and dispose of the gold and items one has created or looted; and the right to play for one's own sake and fulfillment.
 
These rights are not granted by the guild but are a part of and given rise from the players and are inalienable.
 
This guild holds further that it exists only as an institution charged with securing these rights, and that should a guild become destructive of that end, it is the right of the players to alter or to abolish it as they see fit in order to effectively secure their rights.
 
These rights are the only ones treated by this Litany.
They are the only rights formulated in terms of broad abstractions and resting directly on universal ethical principles.
The numerous applications and implementations of these rights, such as the right to attend guild functions or to be tried fairly for the violation of the rights of others, are charged to the Marshal and require for their validation a process of reduction to these abstract rights.

#### Article II
All members of the guild that understand and agree with its founding principles as outlined in Article I and whose membership shall have attained to the duration of ten years since invitation, regardless of lapses in membership, shall form the Veterans of Honor and Valor.
 
The Veterans shall select from among their ranks a single person to serve as Marshal of Honor and Valor.
If there are multiple Veterans willing to serve, the winner of a duel or series of duels will become the Marshal.
The Marshal is still a Veteran regardless of his current elevated position.
When the Marshal decides to step down, he may choose his replacement from among the Veterans.
If he does not make a selection, the Veterans must choose from among themselves using the above method.
 
When any two Veterans duel, each combatant may choose a champion from among any current and willing member of the guild to fight in a duel on their behalf.
The victor of a duel must have struck the final blow and there must have been no combat interference from other players during the duel.

Should a Veteran determine that the Marshal should be replaced, and the Marshal is unwilling to surrender his post, the Veteran may challenge the Marshal in person to a duel.
The Marshal may not refuse the challenge but may choose the setting of the duel.
If the Marshal fails to choose a setting within three days of the challenge being issued, the Veteran may choose the setting, and if the Marshal fails to attend then the duel is forfeit in favor of the Veteran.
If the Veteran is the victor, he shall become the new Marshal.
If the Veteran is not the victor, he shall not be able to challenge the Marshal again for ninety days.
 
Before a Veteran enters his office, he shall take the following oath: “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any guild of which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Litany of Honor and Valor against all enemies, from those outside the guild, to the very Marshal himself should the need arise under my own rational principles and reasonable conscience; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Litany of Honor and Valor; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation.”

#### Article III
The legislative, executive, and judicial power of the guild shall be vested in the Marshal of Honor and Valor.
 
The Marshal must create uniform regulations for: recruitment and dismissal; looting in raids; punishment for breaking social etiquette or guild rules; organizing communication channels outside of the game; organizing raid groups and PvP teams; and, securing gold or materials for progression.
The Marshal may choose to delegate any of these responsibilities to Veterans or Commanders.
 
No regulations can be exercised against a member of the guild ex post facto.

The Marshal may appoint any individual within the guild to whom he delegates a portion of his authority to serve as a Commander for such purposes and until such time that the Marshal may decide.
Before a Commander enters his office, he shall take the following oath: “I, of my own free will, without coercion, promise, or inducement of any sort, after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequences of this oath, do now enroll in the Raiding or PvP Service of the Guild of Honor and Valor. I swear to uphold and defend the Guild of Honor and Valor against all its enemies, to protect and defend the liberties and privileges of all its citizens and civilians, to perform such duties as may be assigned to me by direct or delegated authority, and to obey all orders of the Marshal of Honor and Valor and of all Commanders or delegated persons placed over me, and to require such obedience from all members of the Service or other persons placed under my orders - and, while remaining in active service or upon being granted inactive retired status, to carry out all duties and obligations and to enjoy the privileges of guild citizenship.”
 
The Marshal may delegate powers to groups of Veterans and Commanders to act collectively as legislative, executive, or judicial bodies.
The Marshal may grant to each body the privilege to determine the rules of its proceedings.
Acts of legislative bodies must gain the assent of the Marshal to take effect.

#### Amendment I
(Ratified on the thirtieth of April 2022)

##### Section 1
The requirement of attained duration of years since invitation for Veterans of Honor and Valor is hereby repealed.

##### Section 2
A Veteran may sponsor the invitation of a member of the guild to join the Veterans of Honor and Valor.
When this occurs, the matter shall be put to a vote of the Veterans of Honor and Valor for a period not exceeding three days.
If three fourths of those voting are in favor, the sponsored member shall become a Veteran upon taking the oath.

### §109a. Honor and Valor Treaties and Other Inter-Guild Agreements; contents; admissibility in evidence
1. The Marshal or his designee shall cause to be compiled, edited, indexed, and published, beginning as of July 2, 2021, a compilation entitled "Honor and Valor Treaties and Other Inter-Guild Agreements," which shall contain all treaties to which Honor and Valor is a party that have been proclaimed during each calendar year, and all inter-guild agreements other than treaties to which Honor and Valor is a party that have been signed, proclaimed, or with reference to which any other final formality has been executed, during each calendar year. The said Honor and Valor Treaties and Other Inter-Guild Agreements shall be legal evidence of the treaties, inter-guild agreements other than treaties, and proclamations by the Marshal of such treaties and agreements, therein contained.
2. The Marshal or his designee may determine that publication of certain categories of agreements is not required, if the following criteria are met:
    1. such agreements are not treaties which have been brought into force for Honor and Valor;
    2. the public interest in such agreements is insufficient to justify their publication, because
        1. the agreements are no longer in force;
        2. the agreements do not create private rights or duties, or establish standards intended to govern government action in the treatment of private individuals;
        3. in view of the limited or specialized nature of the public interest in such agreements, such interest can adequately be satisfied by an alternative means; or
        4. the public disclosure of the text of the agreement would, in the opinion of the Marshal, be prejudicial to the security of Honor and Valor; and
    3. copies of such agreements (other than those in paragraph (2)(4)), including certified copies where necessary for litigation or similar purposes, will be made available by the Marshal or his designee upon request.
3. Any determination pursuant to subsection (2) shall be published by Marshal or his designee.
4. The Marshal or his designee shall make publicly available through Discord each treaty or inter-guild agreement proposed to be published in the compilation entitled "Honor and Valor Treaties and Other Inter-Guild Agreements" not later than 180 days after the date on which the treaty or agreement enters into force.

1. The Marshal or his designee shall transmit to the House the text of any inter-guild agreement (including the text of any oral inter-guild agreement, which agreement shall be reduced to writing), other than a treaty, to which Honor and Valor is a party as soon as practicable after such agreement has entered into force with respect to Honor and Valor but in no event later than sixty days thereafter. However, any such agreement the immediate public disclosure of which would, in the opinion of the Marshal, be prejudicial to the security of Honor and Valor shall not be so transmitted to the House but shall be transmitted to the #closed-committee channel in Discord under an appropriate injunction of secrecy to be removed only upon due notice from the Marshal. Any officer of Honor and Valor which enters into any inter-guild agreement on behalf of Honor and Valor shall transmit to the Marshal or his designee the text of such agreement not later than twenty days after such agreement has been signed.

3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an inter-guild agreement may not be signed or otherwise concluded on behalf of Honor and Valor without prior consultation with the Marshal or his designee. Such consultation may encompass a class of agreements rather than a particular agreement.

The Marshal or his designee shall annually submit to the House a report that contains an index of all inter-guild agreements, listed by external entity, date, title, and summary of each such agreement (including a description of the duration of activities under the agreement and the agreement itself), that Honor and Valor—
        1. has signed, proclaimed, or with reference to which any other final formality has been executed, or that has been extended or otherwise modified, during the preceding calendar year; and
        2. has not been published, or is not proposed to be published, in the compilation entitled "Honor and Valor Treaties and Other Inter-Guild Agreements".
    2. The report described in paragraph (1) may be submitted in classified form.
5.  1. Subject to paragraph (2), the Marshal or his designee shall determine for and within the executive branch whether an arrangement constitutes an inter-guild agreement within the meaning of this section.
    2.  1. An arrangement shall constitute an international agreement within the    meaning of this section (other than subsection (3)) irrespective of the duration of activities under the arrangement or the arrangement itself.
        2. Arrangements that constitute an international agreement within the meaning of this section (other than subsection (3)).
6. The Marshal shall, either himself or through the his designee, promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.
7. It is the sense of the House that the executive branch should not prescribe or otherwise commit to or include specific legislative text in a treaty or executive agreement unless the House has authorized such action.

# Title 4—Crime Control and Law Enforcement

## TITLE 4—Front Matter
Title 4 of the Honor and Valor code entitled "Crime Control and Law Enforcement" is codified into positive law and may be cited as '4 H. V. C., §--.'

## CHAPTER 1—OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY

### §1. Purpose
In Honor and Valor, obstructive behavior that has an adverse impact on others' gameplay is prohibited.
Such behavior violates the terms of this statute.
If a violation is confirmed as a result of the Corps of Commanders investigations, they may, in their sole discretion, issue a penalty to the offending guild members as specified by the section defining the offense.

### §2. Communication based conflict
Honor and Valor is a guild where members come together and interact with one another.
Communication is vital in human-to-human interactions, but it goes without saying that individuals feel and interpret things differently and often comments or behavior that are not offensive to one person may make another feel offended or uncomfortable.
Extreme content which Commanders deem particularly disagreeable and undesirable in constructive exchanges between members of the guild is prohibited.

Communication can take place in a variety of styles.
As such, specific words or sentences are not prohibited in and of themselves.
Instead, Commanders look at the whole picture in order to judge the intent and meaning of the communication, in conjunction with how the person on the receiving end perceived it, to determine whether or not the exchange runs afoul of this section.

Please be kind and respectful and keep in mind how others may feel about what you say.
If you think your comment may make another person feel even a little uncomfortable, it would be best to refrain from saying it.

Additionally, something that may be intended as a "joke" between friends could in fact make the other person feel uncomfortable but they may not say so to be considerate.
This rings true even for longtime friends where respect may be more important in the relationship.

Please note, that even in situations where a violation is made, if the parties involved can reach a mutual resolution, Commanders will not then treat it as such.
Communication based conflicts can be resolved via subsequent communication.
Therefore, if you accidentally express something inappropriately, you are encouraged to accept your mistake and take the appropriate action to correct it.

Where the Corps of Commanders determines a member is in violation of this section, the member will be asked to resolve the issue.
If the member cannot or will not do so, a warning will be issued.
Once three warnings for violations of this section have been issued within a ninety-day period and it is violated again within that period, a penalty up to dismissal may be imposed.

### §3. Harassment
"Harassment" is speech and/or behavior that inflicts deep emotional distress on another person.
It is an extremely serious violation.

It is prohibited to do this anywhere an expression can be made, including in-game chat and voice chat.

A non-exhaustive list of behavior, when done with the intent of causing emotional distress, that could constitute harassment in Honor and Valor includes:
* discriminatory expressions based on race/nationality/thinking/gender/sexual orientation/gender identity/disability;
* discriminatory expressions about a state/religion/occupation/organization, etc.;
* expressions that promote, advocate, or direct anyone to commit any form of self-harm;
* obscene/indecent expressions;
* actions that inflict emotional distress by using expressions related to historical events or crimes;
* stalking;
* disclosing a person's information such as contact information with the aim of meeting up in the real world;
* disclosing another person's real-world personal information without permission; and,
* other actions that are generally regarded as inflicting deep emotional distress on another person.

Where the Corps of Commanders determines that harassment has occurred, a warning will be issued.
Once one warning for violation of this section has been issued and it is violated again, a penalty up to dismissal may be imposed.
If the harassment contains the aggravating component of a potential real-life physical threat (e.g. doxxing), the requirement to first issue a warning is waived and the violation may result in immediate dismissal.

### §4. Nuisance behavior
"Nuisance behavior" is speech or behavior that hurts others or obstructs their gameplay, but which is not classified as harassment.
Even if it was not intended, a penalty may be issued if the end result was that another person was hurt, or their gameplay was obstructed.

Where the Corps of Commanders determines a member is in violation of section 4 through section 4d, a warning will be issued.
Once three warnings for violations of these sections have been issued and they are violated again, a penalty up to dismissal may be imposed.

A non-exhaustive list of behavior, when done with or without the intent of causing emotional distress, that could constitute nuisance behavior in Honor and Valor is outlined by subsequent sections.

### §4a. Offensive expression
"Offensive expression" means an expression in general that inflicts emotional distress by being offensive to another person.

It is prohibited to do this anywhere an expression can be made, including in-game chat and voice chat.

A non-exhaustive list of expressions that could constitute offensive expression in Honor and Valor includes:
* aggressive expressions such as violent language/slander/insults/threats;
* expressions that provoke or belittle another person, such as excessive criticism, negation/ridicule;
* expressions that unilaterally reject another person's opinion;
* expressions that compel a playing style (except when in accordance with declarations of the Marshal or the terms of this code);
* expressions that attempt to unilaterally exclude someone from the guild or its activities (except when in accordance with declarations of the Marshal or the terms of this code);
* expressions that are contrary to public order and morals;
* expressions considered impolite or against common sense;
* expressions that significantly lack consideration for others; and,
* other expressions that are offensive to members of the guild.

### §4b. Obstruction of play
"Obstruction of play" refers to all behavior in general that obstructs another member of the guild's gameplay. A non-exhaustive list of examples of obstruction of play in Honor and Valor includes:
* spamming;
* obstructing transit/progress (e.g. intentionally standing directly on top of a key NPC for an extended period of time);
* obstructing the activities of others (e.g. mailing another guild member fishing poles);
* obstructing gameplay using combat (e.g. running mob trains on other guild members, casting Misdirection on a healer, etc.); and,
* aiding the enemy / uncooperative behavior / lethargic behavior (e.g. taking actions intended to benefit the opposing faction in PvP, refusing to heal a person you don't like, etc.).

### §4c. Fraud
"Fraud" is an act of deception intended to deprive a guild member of their full enjoyment of the game or their property.
Fraud occurs most often as a result of breaching in-game agreements between members regarding trading, loot, or betting.

### §4d. Impersonation
"Impersonation" means impersonating or fraudulently claiming to be another guild member, Honor and Valor officers, or any other third party.

### §5. Political, religious, commercial, and promotional activities
The act of engaging in activities and promotions that involve real-life political groups, religious organizations, or business entities that have no connections to Honor and Valor is prohibited within its communications channels.
Charitable projects on behalf of individuals in the guild (e.g. a funding initiative to help a guild member afford a surgery) can be an exception to this regulation permitted at the discretion of the Corps of Commanders.

Where the Corps of Commanders determines a member is in violation of this section, a warning will be issued.
Once three warnings for violations of this section have been issued and it is violated again, a penalty up to dismissal may be imposed.

### §6. Breaking the chain that binds
Should a member of this guild suffer any damages by another member of this guild that is simultaneously in violation of both another authority's policy and the Code of Honor and Valor, the guild asserts the prerogatives of:
* treating of the matter first (i.e. the victim must report the matter to the Corps of Commanders before any other authority); and,
* treating of the matter finally (i.e. the victim must secure permission from the Corps of Commanders to notify any other authority of any matters the Corps of Commanders has already considered, whether or not the offender was actioned by the guild in any way).

The members of this guild by way of accepting an invite agree to submit all disputes arising under this section to arbitration by the Supreme Court of Honor and Valor.
The privilege of arbitration and the appeal thereof shall survive dismissal subsequent to having been found guilty of violating this section and includes the possibility of the reversal of any punitive action taken by the guild which is reversible.
No member of this guild shall challenge the guild's jurisdiction or venue as provided in this section before any other authority.

The only exception to this regulation is a response to a violation of another authority's policy which:
* represents an egregious danger to the victim which is incipient or so imminent that the guild cannot respond in an adequately timely manner; or,
* represents a threat incommensurate to the guild's enforcement capability (e.g. a real-life, physical danger).

The constraints in this section against notifying other authorities shall not extend to:
* any office, bureau, or agency that constitutes a part of the United States government;
* any office, bureau, or agency that constitutes a part of the government of a US State; or,
* any law enforcement agency within the United States of America.

Where the Corps of Commanders determines that a member of the guild has violated this section the violation may result in immediate dismissal.

### §7. Ignoring a Commander's instructions
If a Commander gives an instruction based on a declaration of the Marshal or this code, failure to follow the instruction is a violation which may carry the penalty of immediate dismissal.

## CHAPTER 2—OFFENSES AGAINST HARDCORE PLAYERS

### §101. Murder; Malice Murder; Statutory Murder
1. A player commits the offense of murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another player's hardcore character.
2. Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take the life of another player's hardcore character which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof. Malice shall be implied where no considerable provocation appears and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.
3. A player commits the offense of murder when, in the commission of another criminal act, he or she causes the death of another player's hardcore character irrespective of malice.
4. A player convicted of the offense of murder shall be punished by permanent dismissal from the guild, or execution of the character with which the offense was committed.

### §102. Voluntary Character Slaughter
1. A player commits the offense of voluntary character slaughter when he causes the death of another player's hardcore character under circumstances which would otherwise be murder and if he acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person; however, if there should have been an interval between the provocation and the killing sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard, the killing shall be attributed to deliberate revenge and be punished as murder.
2. A player who commits the offense of voluntary character slaughter, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by suspension from the guild for not less than six weeks nor more than one year.

### §103. Involuntary Character Slaughter
1. A player commits the offense of involuntary character slaughter in the commission of an unlawful act when he causes the death of another player's hardcore character without any intention to do so by the commission of a minor unlawful act. A person who commits the offense of involuntary character slaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by suspension from the guild for not less than six weeks nor more than six months.
2. A player commits the offense of involuntary character slaughter in the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner when he causes the death of another player's hardcore character without any intention to do so, by the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner likely to cause death. A player who commits the offense of involuntary character slaughter in the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished with a fine of gold or suspension not more than two weeks.

### §104. Use of Force in Duels to the Death and Defense of the Alliance
A player is justified in threatening or using force against another's hardcore character when engaged in a duel to the death or in player versus player activity; however, such player is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death of another's hardcore character only if the player has no cause to reasonably believe the opposing player has engaged with them involuntarily.

### §105. Immunity from Criminal Liability of Players Committing Offenses as the Direct Result of a Hardware or Software Defect
1. Any player playing fairly and honorably who is nevertheless hindered in a manner or caused to take an action leading to the death of another's hardcore character by a defect for which convincing evidence or admission by the vendor of the applicable hardware or software is presented shall be immune from any criminal liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result.
2. The purpose of this Code section is to provide for those players who act in good faith to represent the guild of Honor and Valor with distinction. This Code section shall be liberally construed so as to carry out the purposes thereof.

## CHAPTER 3—OFFENSES IN FORMAL COMBAT

### §201. Desertion
Any member of the guild who uses an ability (e.g. [Vanish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1857/vanish), [Feign Death](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5384/feign-death)) or item (e.g. [Hearthstone](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6948/hearthstone), [Flask of Petrification](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13506/flask-of-petrification)) to flee combat with intent to evade the possible failure of the engagement and without consent from the leader of the party or raid in which the member was joined when combat began is guilty of desertion.

Any person found guilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished by lifetime dismissal from the guild or such other punishment as an adjudicator may direct.

Any member of the guild who in the presence of other guilds—
* shamefully abandons any duty he has agreed to undertake;
* through disobedience, neglect, or intentional misconfuct endangers the safety of any fellow members of a party or raid;
* is guilty of cowardly conduct (Conduct is “cowardly” only if it amounts to misbehavior which was motivated by fear. A mere display of apprehension is not sufficient.);
* quits his duty in quest of any personal gain (e.g. to loot, to turn in a quest);
* causes false alarms in any party or raid;
* willfully fails to do his utmost to achieve the objective of the party or raid; or,
* does not afford all practicable relief and assistance to any fellow members of a party or raid when engaged in battle;

# Title 7—Raiding

## TITLE 7—Front Matter
Title 7 of the Honor and Valor code entitled "Raiding" is codified into positive law and may be cited as '7 H. V. C., §--.'

## CHAPTER 1—LOOT SYSTEM

### §1. Selection
When an encounter or instance is declared as progression under the terms of section 101, the Commander-in-chief or his designee shall post a link to the softres.it web site for that encounter or instance and pin it in a channel in Discord specifically created for auditing progression loot.
This channel shall be visible to all members of the guild, although only those having the Commander rank or higher will be able to post in it.
The raid date on softres.it shall not be set so that members may denote and later revise what loot they are seeking from that encounter or instance.

Creating a reservation entry on the appropriate softres.it link for the raid is optional.
When a raid member's selections are required by the process in section 2 but they have not created a reservation entry, the best-in-slot items for the raid member's specialization in the content phase containing the encounter as determined by a published class guide excepting what items the raid member already has shall stand in substitution.

### §2. Process
1. Only guild raids for encounters or instances that the House has resolved to be progression raids are governed by the loot system.
2. Guild raids are master looted with a loot quality threshold of epic.
3. For each raid, the raid leader shall designate at least three persons in the guild, potentially including himself, to serve as the raid's loot council. The master looter shall be a member of the loot council.
4. When a drop containing items that bind when picked-up occurs, the raid's loot council shall review the softres.it raid or the loot council's chosen guide information to determine which members of the raid are interested in the item and the audit log of items thus far distributed, and deliberate upon whom shall receive it. The raid leader may direct the master looter to loot items to himself in order that they may be traded to the designated recipient later should he feel raiding efficiency will benefit from it.
5. When the loot council arrives at a majority opinion regarding a particular item, the item will be distributed to the member selected, the softres.it raid will be amended to strike the item from that raid member's desired items, and the distribution will be transcribed in the audit log.

## CHAPTER 2—PROGRESSION

When the House resolves that an encounter or instance is a progresion raid, the Commander-in-chief is hereby authorized and directed to employ the entire Raiding Service of the Guild of Honor and Valor and the resources of the guild to carry on war against the named aggressors of the instance; and, to bring the conflict to a successful termination, all the resources of the guild are pledged by the House of Represent’n of the Guild of Honor and Valor.

### §202. Courts always open; powers unrestricted by expiration of sessions
All courts of Honor and Valor shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and orders.

The continued existence or expiration of a session of a court in no way affects the power of the court to do any act or take any proceeding.

### §203. Oaths of adjudicators
Each adjudicator of Honor and Valor shall take the following oath or affirmation in addition to that required by the Litany before performing the duties of his office: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich of power, skill, and popularity, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as a judicial officer under the Litany and laws of the guild of Honor and Valor.”

### §204. Disqualification of adjudicator
1. Any adjudicator of Honor and Valor shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
2. He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:
   1. Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;
   2. He knows that he, individually or his relative, has any interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;
   3. He or his relative, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the relative of such a person:
      1. Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party;
      2. Is acting as counsel in the proceeding;
      3. Is known by the adjudicator to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;
      4. Is to the adjudicator's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any adjudicator to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he or she individually, or his relative, has an interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the adjudicator or relative, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.
